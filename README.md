# ☕ Object-Oriented Coffee Machine ☕

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Coffee Machine** README! This delightful Python script showcases the essence of object-oriented programming by simulating a coffee machine experience. Buckle up for a journey through cups of java and code!

## 📜 Introduction to the Coffee Art

The **Object-Oriented Coffee Machine** script is your gateway to a virtual coffeehouse. Through the magic of object-oriented programming, this script brings to life a coffee machine that can brew, dispense, and manage the coffee-making process. Enjoy every sip of code!

## 🚀 How to Brew the Magic

1. Open the script in your code workshop.
2. Delve into the world of OOP by exploring classes and methods.
3. Experience the coffee machine's wizardry by crafting instances of the coffee maker and interacting with its methods.
4. Watch as the machine churns out coffee goodness and handles orders seamlessly.

## 🛠️ Customization Aroma

Embrace the art of customization by modifying the script to your liking. Change coffee types, add new methods, or enhance the user interaction for a personalized experience.

# ☕ License to Brew

This script comes with a generous MIT License. Brew responsibly and check the LICENSE file for more details.
